# cephei.uk Network Documentation

This book documents my home network. It is here to serve as a reminder to myself
of all the network details and to serve as an educational tool to help others
design and build networks on a similar scale.

If you are reading this book and you are not me, I hope this book gives you some
inspiration and template configurations for your network. Feel free to contact
me with any feedback, appreciation or flames.

If you are reading this book and you *are* me, I hope this book helps you (me)
debug whatever has broken!
